# nixos-config

This repo contains my NixOS configuration. I've split it up into different files to keep it organized and easily readable.

To use the config simply copy it to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`
Make sure to backup your `configuration.nix`, if needed! The following commands will overwrite it.

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:va1entin/nixos-config.git
cd nixos-config
sudo cp configuration.nix /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
```
